								As a commitment to the organizers that when Indonesia was chosen to host the event World Prayer Assembly held its first second after the implementation of Seoul South Korea 29 years ago , that Indonesia does not just want to be a grand event , but organizers hope to continue an ongoing prayer movement as a wave new ( new Wave ) is from God .<br/><br/>
								Cannot be denied that South Korea becomes superior in the eyes of the world because of the hard work and driven by strong prayers, prayers that are raised by the People of God. In 1950 was the poorest country in Asia with a GNP USD 50 years but in 1955 increased by 218 times. In 2010 the country became one of the 3 strongest economic powers in Asia after China and Japan, is also one of the 10 most powerful countries in the world. Christianity sped away up to 40 percent and become the second largest missionary sending after the USA.<br/><br/>
								Wave of Prayer in Indonesia should be more extensive and dynamic flare is not limited to inside the church building, hall, concert prayer, worship Kingdom, cell group but a lifestyle of prayer God's people wherever they are both in school, at work, on campus , in the market , in the Mall also the environment around our homes.<br/><br/>

With the aim to motivate God people to care about and make friends with neighbors / community environment.

								Father Eddy Purwanto from KWI (representative form catholic churches) : strongly support this movement and should be socialized to people as possible , this movement does not stop in the action of prayer but the prayer was answered concerns in the community . "From Altar to the market and from the market back to the Altar ", from the Altar we draw a refreshing living spirit to be use in the Market in society, but of society or in the markets that we also carry what has been done as an offering to God for sanctified and become a new force for us when I had to go back to the market / society.<br/><br/>

Robinson Nainggolan of PGPI (Pentecostal Churches): Pentecostal Church of Indonesia welcomed the move My Home as a fruit or a follow-up of the WPA 2012 , this movement is very important to do because it is the embodiment of the Great Commission .

								3.	My Home One, an outreach to the community movement neglected by the church, such as drug users, people living with HIV / AIDS, sex workers, genk motors, homeless, scavengers and other tissues.<br/><br/>
								Home My goal through this KDN that all components of both networks and facilitators JDS, JDW, JDA even the pastors and leaders can adopt this program, so that every region in Indonesia will be met by the prayers of the righteous who will change the circumstances.<br/><br/>
								Habakkuk 2:14 For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.<br/><br/>
